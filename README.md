# Chaos Awakens
Chaos Awakens is a remaster of both the old Minecraft/[DangerZone](http://dangerzonegame.net/) mod [OreSpawn](https://www.dangerzonegame.net/dz-21-mods.html) and [SoulsOfTheFallen's Chaos Awakens mod pack](https://web.archive.org/web/20180314164908/http://www.dangerzonegame.net/mods.html), built from the ground up. This is the branch for the 1.16.5 version for Minecraft Forge.


⚠️ This  brantch is unmaintained by the devs as of now go to the main forge brantch


## Download
Due to recent drama and various mass reports by unknown sources, the mod was taken down from CurseForge until further notice. Please do **not** harass **anyone** in the CurseForge moderation team or **any** competitor mod developer for what you think they did. They are humans and we are too, and we all make mistakes.

All previous downloads are now located [in this page](https://invalid2.github.io/downloads.html) for now. Later builds will come up in the [Releases](https://github.com/Chaos-Awakens-Mod-Team/ChaosAwakens/releases/) page.

### Required Dependencies
**1.16.5 (Forge):** [Forge v36.1.1 and up](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html), [GeckoLib v3.0 and up](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3a70886), [AttributeFix v10.0.1 and above](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/attributefix/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3a70886)

## FAQ
### Q: Will you make a *Fabric* version?
**A:** Yes, one is currently in the works! We plan to have a first build of it released at a similar time as the *Forge* version.

### Q: Will this mod be ported to version x.x.x?
**A (for versions below 1.16.5):** Yes, but only versions between ranging from 1.7.10 to 1.12.2, and it's still a matter of time as 1.16.5-1.17.x is our main focus version.

**A (for versions 1.17 and above):** We haven't fully decided to port to 1.17.x for *Forge*. However, a 1.17.x build is being created for *Fabric*.

### Q: Is this created with *MCreator*?
**A:** No. You can check the mod's code and almost nothing relating to *MCreator* is present. No separate item/block classes, no procedures, etc.

### Q: Who started/made this?
**A:** This was started as an idea of the former *OreSpawn* update modders and admins of the [DangerZone modding Discord](https://discord.gg/hs6FJEDtMd) started the idea about a while after it was cancelled. After a while, it started becoming popular! We hired many amazing developers who have made all this possible.

### Q: Could you please add \<insert base *OreSpawn* element(s) here\>?! This isn't *OreSpawn* without it/them!
**A:** We aren't porting everything from *OreSpawn* in its pure form, and so not only thought is needed to remake that content, it also means that some content will not make the cut! This includes:
- Girlfriends, Boyfriends (or Partners) and the Rose Sword
- Criminals/Bankers/Politicians and the White House
- Whiners (aka *"modern day zombies"*)
- Russians, including Sergey Lavrov and Vladimir Putin
- Everything which is there for the sake of being there (such as Flattop and the Mashup Dimension)

### Q: Why do the assets look so different from *OreSpawn*? Why can't you guys just re-use the assets or make them more alike?
**A:** Here are a few reasons why:
- Most *OreSpawn* textures look pretty outdated, are just lazy, or simply don't fit with Minecraft's art style;
- The creator of *OreSpawn*, [**Richard "Danger" Clark**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Tsf31uosncmWCICYO52Dw), had commented on our former CurseForge page to not use the assets that were created for his mod, as seen in the image below. We will **not** be using anything from the mod that he owns (textures, models, etc.) unless a specific modeller of the mod gives us permission to use theirs.

- Even if we were granted rights to use the assets, they wouldn't fit with the existing assets, and having both would bring more issues than fix things.
